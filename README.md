## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Paulo Henrique, also called PH. So, refer to me just as PH if you want. I am software developer specialized in JavaScript/TypeScript with over 8 years of experience building efficient, maintainable and scalable code through legacy system migrations, development of full-fledged web applications, third-party APIâ€™s integrations, Chrome browser extension and more.

My work has been heavily focused on frontend development, particularly with React, Next.js, Typescript. But despite my frontend expertise, I bring a strong backend foundation that allows me to work effectively across the entire stack. Additionally, I'm keen to explore DevOps tooling, cloud computing, open source, compilers, and back-end/multiplatform development in Node and Kotlin.

An interesting fact: I love solving programming challenges. My passion for competitive programming fueled my college studies, leading to a scholarship and teaching opportunities and the consolidation of my career as software engineer. Highlights: 2014, 2015, and 2016 regional participation in the [Maratona de ProgramaÃ§Ã£o Brasileira](https://maratona.sbc.org.br/), including 2016 regional championship; and 2016 national finalist.
