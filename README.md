## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Paulo Henrique, also called PH. So, refer to me just as PH if you want. I am passionate software developer crafting efficient, maintainable and scalable code through legacy system migrations, full-fledged web applications, third-party APIâ€™s integrations, scripting, browser extensions.

An interesting fact: I love solving programming challenges. My passion for competitive programming fueled my college studies, leading to a scholarship and teaching opportunities and the consolidation of my career as software engineer. Highlights: 2014, 2015, and 2016 regional participation in the [Maratona de ProgramaÃ§Ã£o Brasileira](https://maratona.sbc.org.br/), including 2016 regional championship; and 2016 national finalist.

For now, Iâ€™m digging into Java/Kotlin knowledge, while keeping an eye on Go. My expertise is JavaScript/TypeScript, mainly on front-end web land (React/Next, some Vue/Nuxt and all ecosystem around them), but I also have strong fundamentals in backend development with Node.
